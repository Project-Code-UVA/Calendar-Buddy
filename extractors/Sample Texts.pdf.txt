Formatted example *the unbolded text could be omitted for now. But for more complex 
parsing we can try to get the program to read the lines to find clues about the location! 
●​ Should ignore emojis 
●​ Should understand that when no year is included, the next closest date is implied.

More challenging example 
 
●​ Must ignore italics (those are not events, just notes) 
●​ Must ignore irrelevant words and symbols (emojis and “INFINITY!!” 
●​ For 10/26: “forever”, may be interpreted to last “a very long time”. But we have to tell 
the program how to interpret those, ideally, the program would infer that and make the 
event last until midnight. 
●​ Entries with no specified time should be interpreted as “all day” event 
●​ Typo-fixing? 
●​ Pattern recognition?
